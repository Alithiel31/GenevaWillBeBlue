              <p> Mostly yes! Niantic usually does allow a Mission Day after an Anomaly. We are still in the early
                stages
                of planning that, and more information will follow as it becomes available.

                Will the NL-1331 van be present in Geneva?

              <p>
                We will request the NL-1331 van to be sent to Geneva in-game for the anomaly event. However, the final
                decision rests with Niantic. We will provide updates as soon as we receive more information from them.

                Absolutely! You can buy all the swag you need from our swag shop when it's open. Don't worry, the
                information will be widely spread when the shop is open.
                Unfortunately, you have to pick up all the swag in Geneva. If you cannot make it, you can still buy
                our swag and ask your friends to pick it up for you. There will of course also be some free swag
                available on the day.</p>
