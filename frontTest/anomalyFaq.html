                                we are thrilled to bring the Ingress community to this iconic location. From its global
                                significance to its deep-rooted place in XM lore, Geneva offers the perfect backdrop for
                                an unforgettable operation. We look forward to delivering a world-class experience for

                                many teams choose to meet up earlier in the day for brunch or a briefing—it's the
                                perfect chance to gear up and get to know your squad before the XM starts flowing!</p>

                                faction by providing gear to fellow agents or joining our pre-anomaly farming events to
                                stock up on high-level items. Most importantly, help us grow the team—spread the word to
                                other agents and make sure they know where to sign up. Every recruit makes our presence
                                in Geneva stronger! If you don't know where to ask, don't hesitate to reach out to us <a
