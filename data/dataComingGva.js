        "The journey takes approximately 7 minutes, and regular regional tickets are sufficient — no special airport fare is required.",

There are frequent direct services to <a href=\"https://www.sbb.ch/fr/transport/ferroviaire/station/genève-cornavin\">Genève Cornavin</a> from major cities such as Zurich, Lausanne, Bern and Basel, operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB/CFF/FFS).",
        "To buy tickets for train journeys in Switzerland you can use the official <a href=\"https://www.sbb.ch/\">SBB</a> website or app. Both offer excellent mobile apps with QR-code tickets. Swiss ticketing is generally straightforward: tickets are valid for a specific route and date, but not for a specific train, giving you flexibility if your plans change.",
        "Tickets bought online are usually provided as a QR code in the app or as a PDF on your phone. You do not need to print them. Simply show the QR code to the ticket inspector when asked. Swiss train stations generally do not have platform gates, but ticket inspections are frequent and fines for traveling without a valid ticket are high.",

        "To plan your route within Geneva or from surrounding areas, you may want to use the <a href=\"https://citymapper.com/\">Citymapper</a> app or the SBB app. Both provide excellent route planning that includes trains, trams and buses, and are often more user-friendly than Google Maps for public transport.",
        "If you are coming from the European mainland by train, Geneva is easily accessible via international high-speed and regional connections from France, Italy and Germany. Tickets can be purchased directly through national rail operators or via Interrail. Trains have no strict luggage restrictions like planes, are more environmentally friendly, and arrive directly in the city center."

There are no border controls for passengers travelling within the Schengen area, but random customs checks may occur. This is also a convenient option if you are travelling with a dog.",
        "If you are coming from Italy, you can reach Switzerland via the <a href=\"https://www.gotthardtunnel.ch/\">Gotthard Tunnel</a> or other Alpine passes, depending on the season and traffic conditions. From Germany, the Swiss motorway network offers direct connections via Basel or Zurich.",

        "Parking in Geneva is limited and can be expensive. Some hotels offer private parking, but many do not. Instead, they may provide or sell temporary parking permits for nearby residential zones. These permits must be displayed clearly in your car and are usually valid for a limited duration.",

Nearby towns such as Ferney-Voltaire, Saint-Genis-Pouilly, Annemasse and Saint-Julien-en-Genevois offer more affordable accommodation options."
