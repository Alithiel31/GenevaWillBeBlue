              <p>Following Niantic's selection of Geneva as a host city for the Q2 2026 Anomaly series,
                we are thrilled to bring the Ingress community to this iconic location. From its global
                significance to its deep-rooted place in XM lore, Geneva offers the perfect backdrop for
                an unforgettable operation. We look forward to delivering a world-class experience for
                agents everywhere!</p>

              <p>While we await the final operational directives from NIA researchers, we anticipate the
                full ruleset for the Q2 series to be declassified by early April. In the meantime, our
                team is already hard at work scouting the local XM landscape to ensure Geneva is ready
                for the challenge!</p>

              <p>Niantic has streamlined the anomaly experience! Earning your event badge is now easier
                than ever: simply join us on the ground in Geneva and interact with the designated event
                portals during the window. Similar to the Second Sunday format, your presence and
                activity at the site are all that's needed to secure your medal.</p>

              <p>While the badge is individual, the victory is collective! You'll be assigned to a
                tactical team alongside fellow agents to help us control the city. Playing in a group is
                the best way to experience the energy of the day and ensures our coordination is
                flawless. Once you sign up, we'll provide you with a specific briefing, including your
                team assignment and start times.</p>

              <p>Whether you're coming with a crew or arriving solo, there's a place for you! You're
                welcome to form a team with friends after signing up—many of our veteran agents travel
                in established groups. But if you're new or coming alone, don't worry: we'll match you
                with a team that fits your pace, language, and experience level. It's a great way to
                make new friends and dive into the heart of the action!</p>

              <p>While we're waiting for the official NIA schedule, anomalies typically kick off in the
                afternoon. We'll share the exact timeline the moment Niantic confirms it. That said,
                many teams choose to meet up earlier in the day for brunch or a briefing—it's the
                perfect chance to gear up and get to know your squad before the XM starts flowing!.</p>

              <p>There are plenty of ways to get involved before the big day! You can help strengthen the
                faction by providing gear to fellow agents or joining our pre-anomaly farming events to
                stock up on high-level items. Most importantly, help us grow the team—spread the word to
                other agents and make sure they know where to sign up. Every recruit makes our presence
                in Geneva stronger! If you don't know where to ask, don't hesitate to reach out to us <a
