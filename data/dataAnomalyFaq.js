        "question": "Why is there an Anomaly in Geneva?",

        "question": "What type of gameplay does the anomaly in Geneva have?",
        "answer": "While we await the final operational directives from NIA researchers, we anticipate the full ruleset for the Q2 series to be declassified by early April.

        "id": "faq-4",
        "question": "Why is there no Niantic registration?",
        "answer": "Niantic has streamlined the anomaly experience! Earning your event badge is now easier than ever: simply join us on the ground in Geneva and interact with the designated event portals during the window. Similar to the Second Sunday format, your presence and activity at the site are all that's needed to secure your medal."

    {
        "id": "faq-5",
        "question": "What do I do on the D-day?",
        "answer": "While the badge is individual, the victory is collective! You'll be assigned to a tactical team alongside fellow agents to help us control the city. Playing in a group is the best way to experience the energy of the day and ensures our coordination is flawless. Once you sign up, we'll provide you with a specific briefing, including your team assignment and start times."
    },
    {
        "id": "faq-6",
        "question": "Can I be on a team with my friends?",
        "answer": "Whether you're coming with a crew or arriving solo, there's a place for you! You're welcome to form a team with friends after signing up—many of our veteran agents travel in established groups. But if you're new or coming alone, don't worry: we'll match you with a team that fits your pace, language, and experience level. It's a great way to make new friends and dive into the heart of the action!"
    },
    {
        "id": "faq-7",
        "question": "What time does the anomaly start?",
        "answer": "While we're waiting for the official NIA schedule, anomalies typically kick off in the afternoon. We'll share the exact timeline the moment Niantic confirms it. That said, many teams choose to meet up earlier in the day for brunch or a briefing—it's the perfect chance to gear up and get to know your squad before the XM starts flowing!"
    },
    {
        "id": "faq-8",
        "question": "Can I still support my team if I cannot attend?",
        "answer": "There are plenty of ways to get involved before the big day! You can help strengthen the faction by providing gear to fellow agents or joining our pre-anomaly farming events to stock up on high-level items. Most importantly, help us grow the team—spread the word to other agents and make sure they know where to sign up. Every recruit makes our presence in Geneva stronger! If you don't know where to ask, don't hesitate to reach out to us <a href=\"https://res.blue/group/geneva-birthplace-of-ingress\">on our community group</a>."
