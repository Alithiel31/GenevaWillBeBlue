            The nearest airport to Geneva is <a href="https://www.gva.ch/fr/">Genève Cointrin</a>.
            Geneva Airport (GVA) is an international hub, the home of EasyJet and SWISS, with
            numerous affordable connections across Europe and beyond. The airport is directly
            connected to the Swiss rail network, with frequent trains from the airport station
            to Geneva Cornavin (the main train station) every 10-15 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The journey takes approximately 7 minutes, and regular regional tickets are
            sufficient — no special airport fare is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Geneva Cornavin, the city center is easily accessible by public transport or
            on foot. Trams and buses from <a href="https://www.tpg.ch/fr">TPG</a> run frequently
            throughout the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geneva Airport is located just minutes from the city center, making arrival smooth and
            <strong>stress-free</strong> for international visitors.

            If you are coming from elsewhere in Switzerland, Geneva is very well connected by train.
            There
            are
            frequent direct services to <a
              href="https://www.sbb.ch/fr/transport/ferroviaire/station/genève-cornavin">Genève
              Cornavin</a> from major cities such as Zurich, Lausanne, Bern
            and
            Basel, operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB/CFF/FFS).
          </p>

          <p>
            To buy tickets for train journeys in Switzerland you can use the official
            <a href="https://www.sbb.ch/">SBB</a> website or app. Both offer excellent mobile apps
            with
            QR-code
            tickets. Swiss ticketing is generally straightforward: tickets are valid for a specific
            route
            and
            date, but not for a specific train, giving you flexibility if your plans change.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tickets bought online are usually provided as a QR code in the app or as a PDF on your
            phone.
            You do
            not need to print them. Simply show the QR code to the ticket inspector when asked.
            Swiss
            train
            stations generally do not have platform gates, but ticket inspections are frequent and
            fines
            for
            traveling without a valid ticket are high.
          </p>

              Cornavin station</a> is located in the city center and offers easy connections to
            local

            trams and regional trains. Trains in Switzerland are known for being punctual, clean and
            reliable.

            To plan your route within Geneva or from surrounding areas, you may want to use the
            <a href="https://citymapper.com/">Citymapper</a> app or the SBB app. Both provide
            excellent
            route
            planning that includes trains, trams and buses, and are often more user-friendly than
            Google
            Maps
            for public transport.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are coming from the European mainland by train, Geneva is easily accessible via
            international
            high-speed and regional connections from France, Italy and Germany. Tickets can be
            purchased
            directly through national rail operators or via Interrail. Trains have no strict luggage
            restrictions like planes, are more environmentally friendly, and arrive directly in the
            city
            center.

          <p>
            The main long-distance coach companies serving Geneva are <a href="https://www.flixbus.com/">FlixBus</a> and
            <a href="https://www.blablacar.co.uk/bus">BlaBlaCar Bus</a>. They operate frequent
            services
            to
            and
            from major cities in Switzerland and neighbouring countries such as France, Italy and
            Germany.
            Coaches serve
            <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/sRXyTHDvtLkmhz799">Genève Gare Routière</a>, which is
            located
            in the city centre
            close to the lake.
          </p>

          <p>
            Geneva Airport is also well connected by coach services, mainly to destinations in
            France.Some routes stop directly at Genève Aéroport, while others connect via nearby French
            towns
            such as Annecy, Chamonix or Lyon.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coach tickets are usually bound to a specific departure time. Some operators offer
            flexible ticket options or allow changes for a small fee, which can be useful when arriving by
            plane in
            case of flight delays, border controls or luggage collection taking longer than expected.
          </p>

          <p>
            You do not need to print your tickets. A QR code on your phone is sufficient and
            accepted by all major coach operators.

        <div class="accordion-content">

          <p>
            To come to Geneva from mainland Europe, travelling by car is straightforward thanks to
            Switzerland's central location and well-developed motorway network. Geneva can be reached easily
            from France, Italy and Germany.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are coming from France, Geneva is accessible via several major road routes,
            including from Lyon, Annecy and Chamonix. There are no border controls for passengers travelling
            within the Schengen area, but random customs checks may occur. This is also a convenient option
            if you are travelling with a dog.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are coming from Italy, you can reach Switzerland via the <a
              href="https://www.gotthardtunnel.ch/">Gotthard Tunnel</a> or other Alpine passes, depending
            on the season and traffic conditions. From Germany, the Swiss motorway network offers direct
            connections via Basel or Zurich.
          </p>

          <p>
            Swiss motorways require a motorway vignette. You can buy a physical vignette or a
            digital e-vignette in advance or at the border. Once in Switzerland, motorway driving is
            generally smooth and well signposted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Parking in Geneva is limited and can be expensive. Some hotels offer private parking,
            but many do not. Instead, they may provide or sell temporary parking permits for nearby
            residential zones. These permits must be displayed clearly in your car and are usually valid for
            a limited duration.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you do not have parking at your accommodation and do not need your car during your
            stay,
            you
            may
            want to use one of the <a
              href="https://www.parkopedia.fr/parking/parc_de_stationnement/arcades/1201/gen%C3%A8ve/">Park
              & Ride (P+R)</a>
            facilities around Geneva. These are located on the main
            access routes to the city and are well connected to the city centre by tram or bus.
          </p>

          <p>
            On-street parking is available throughout the city in designated zones. Blue zones allow
            free
            parking for a limited time using a parking disc, while white zones are paid and
            time-limited.
            Always check the signs carefully, as rules vary by area.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you prefer pre-booked parking and cost is not an issue, there are several public and
            private
            parking garages in and around the city centre. Prices are relatively high, especially
            for
            full-day
            parking.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do not recommend parking in the most central or lakeside areas unless necessary, as
            these
            are
            among the most expensive zones and often have strict time limits.

            Staying in Geneva can be expensive, but there are still plenty of accommodation options
            available.
            The usual booking websites work well, and there is also a good selection of hotels,
            hostels
            and
            serviced apartments throughout the city.
          </p>

          <p>
            Budget-conscious travellers should consider hostels or shared rooms, especially if
            travelling
            solo
            or in a small group. Hostel beds can be found from around €50 per night, while more
            affordable
            hotels usually start at around €130 per night.

            If you would rather stay outdoors, there are also a few camp sites near Geneva. These
            are
            generally a short bus or tram ride from the city centre, so you will need to use public
            transport
            to reach central Geneva.

          <p>
            🧾A nice bonus if you stay in Geneva itself: your accommodation will usually provide a
            free
            public
            transport pass for the duration of your stay. This pass covers buses, trams, trains
            within
            the
            Geneva area and even the lake boats.

          <p>
            💸 If you cannot find something within your budget directly in Geneva, looking along the
            main
            tram
            and
            train lines, or just across the French border, is often a good alternative. This is
            especially
            practical if you do not plan to stay out late in the city centre after evening events.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to save money, it may also be worth staying just across the border in
            France.
            Nearby towns such as Ferney-Voltaire, Saint-Genis-Pouilly, Annemasse and
            Saint-Julien-en-Genevois
            offer more affordable accommodation options.
          </p>

          <p>
            These towns are typically around 8 km from central Geneva, with accommodation often
            starting
            from
            around €80 per night. Public transport connections are reliable, frequent and easy to
            use.
            Apps
            like
            Citymapper or Google Maps are very helpful for planning your journeys.
          </p>

          <p>
            🚊Public transport in and around Geneva runs frequently throughout the day, with
            extended
            services
            in
            the evenings and on weekends, making commuting from nearby towns straightforward.
          </p>

          <p>
            Budget-friendly accommodation in Geneva and surrounding areas tends to fill up quickly,
            especially
            on weekends, so booking early is highly recommended.
