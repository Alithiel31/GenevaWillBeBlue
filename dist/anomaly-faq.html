From its global significance to its deep-rooted place in XM lore, Geneva offers the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable operation.

That said, many teams choose to meet up earlier in the day for brunch or a briefing—it's the perfect chance to gear up and get to know your squad before the XM starts flowing!</p>

                                    <p>There are plenty of ways to get involved before the big day! You can help strengthen the faction by providing gear to fellow agents or joining our pre-anomaly farming events to stock up on high-level items. Most importantly, help us grow the team—spread the word to other agents and make sure they know where to sign up. Every recruit makes our presence in Geneva stronger! If you don't know where to ask, don't hesitate to reach out to us <a href="https://res.blue/group/geneva-birthplace-of-ingress">on our community group</a>.</p>
