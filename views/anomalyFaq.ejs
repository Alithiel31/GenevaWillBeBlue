<h2>Anomaly FAQ</h2>
<p>In Ingress, anomalies are the most exciting kind of competitive event.</p>

<button>
  What is an anomaly?
</button>

<div class="card-body">
  XM Anomalies are large, competitive cross faction events run by Niantic. For a detailed explanation,
  please have a
  look at <a href="https://fevgames.net/ingress/ingress-guide/concepts/anomaly/">the Fev Games wiki</a>.

<button>
  Why is the anomaly in Brighton?
</button>

  <div class="card-body">
    Whilst Niantic made the decision to host the anomaly in Brighton for the Echo series, we're excited to host an event
    for Niantic in the vibrant and colourful seaside town of Brighton and can't wait to make it a successful and fun day
    for everyone!
  </div>


      <button>
        What type of gameplay does the Echo anomaly have?
      </button>


  <div>
      We don't know this yet, however we're hoping we will have more of an idea of the rules for the Echo anomaly series
      by the beginning of April.
    </div>



      <button>
        Why is there no Niantic registration?
      </button>
  

  <div>
      Niantic has changed how this works. It is now enough to just show up and interact with the
      designated
      event portals to get the anomaly badge, similar to the Second Sunday event.

      <p>This will depend on your team's assignment. You will be on a team with other agents. Playing in a
        group helps us to coordinate everything on the day.
        We'll be able to give you more specific information about start time closer to the anomaly date, once
        you sign up.

      <p>You can create your own team with your friends after you have signed up. Many players sign up in
        groups that always go to anomalies together. But it's OK if you don't know anybody yet. We can assign
        you to a team that matches your speed, language and experience.

      <button>
        What time does the anomaly start?
      </button>
   
      <p>We don't know the answer yet, but historically an anomaly does not officially start until afternoon.
        We will give you more specific timings once Niantic releases them. However, your team may decide to
        meet up earlier in the day so that everyone can get to know each other.
      </p>



      <button>
        Can I still support my team if I cannot attend?
      </button>
   

      <p>Yes, you can provide them items, set up farming events prior to the anomaly, and tell other people
        about the anomaly and where to sign up (here).
