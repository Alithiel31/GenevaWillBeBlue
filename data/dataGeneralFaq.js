        "question": "Will there be lots of swag?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You can buy all the swag you need from our swag shop when it's open. Don't worry, the information will be widely spread when the shop is open. Unfortunately, you have to pick up all the swag in Geneva. If you cannot make it, you can still buy our swag and ask your friends to pick it up for you. There will of course also be some free swag available on the day."
